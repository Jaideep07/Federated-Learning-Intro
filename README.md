### Federated Learning 
Wikipedia definition "<i>Federated learning (also known as collaborative learning) is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them.</i>"

### Prerequisite*
- Familiarity of TensorFlow framework
  - [TensorFlow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) (refer the beginner's section).
- Basic understanding of neural networks and their layers
  - [Significane of various layers in neural networks](https://iq.opengenus.org/purpose-of-different-layers-in-ml/#:~:text=Layers%20are%20made%20up%20of,to%20the%20number%20of%20layers.). 
  - [Neural Network implemntation on fashion MNIST](https://becominghuman.ai/step-by-step-neural-network-tutorial-for-beginner-cc71a04eedeb).
